## Code is meant to be interactive.

1.  Head to [repl.it](http://repl.it)
2.  Write some code in your favorite language.
3.  Copy and paste the url for your repl into a Medium post.
4.  Publish the post to make the code interactive.

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://repl.it/@WillKoehrsen/basicpython?lite=true">
    </iframe>
</div>

*Interactive code. In a Medium article! (from [repl.it](http://repl.it)).*

Feel free to play around with the code above. This is a simple example, but you can create complex scripts for readers to run in many languages.

#### Notes

*   The code is only fully interactive _after_ you publish
*   You can add packages, data files, or include multiple scripts in your repl
*   This does work on mobile although not perfectly
*   Each time the page is reloaded, the packages are installed

Besides embedding code in your articles, repl.it has a great [discussion forum](https://repl.it/talk) and [interactive exercises](https://repl.it/community) to learn coding.
